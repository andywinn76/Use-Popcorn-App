Collect and rate your favorite movies using API calls, and React's useState, useEffect, and custom use hooks.

This app was created while coding along with Jonas React course entitled "The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Next.js, Redux & More" which can be found here:

https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/

This is a code-along course and provides a very deep understanding of how and why React works the way it does. This lesson was especially helpful while learning React hooks.

App-v1.js uses a pre-generated array to simulate movies being stored locally. This provides basic app functionality but no API calls to search for movies.

App-v2.js begins to build on functionality including extracting the star rating system into a separate component. Additionally, search functionality via API call to ombdapi.com is implemented.

App-v3.js adds custom hooks useMovies to query API for a list of movies and useLocalStorageState as a reusable hook to read previously added movies when the app mounts.

App.js is teh final version, with a useKey custom hook allowing behavior of any keypress to be read, resulting in the behavior defined by the function passed into the hook.

This coding exercise was challenging and fun and left me with a deep understanding of hooks, state, and much more.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
